# Random card generator

Random Letter Generator is a React and Next.js application. It showcases such things as server functions and API requests, context/state manipulation, code structure and algorithms. And itâ€™s all written in Typescript!

## Getting Started

We recommend using node 18 or higher.

### Run the development server

```bash:
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Features

- Generate random letters and display them on a grid (using Next.js [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations](server-functions))
- Request an API endpoint to generate a secret code

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and see the result.
